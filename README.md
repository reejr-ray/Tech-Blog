Project with the goal of starting a tech blog and running multiple applications on a single webpage!

As of right now, there are two sections I will be devoting time to. 
1. A test server section where I will be researching different HTML, Javascript, Node, React, and other topics related to web design. 
- This section will contain comments listing a portion of what I researched until the tech blog is up and running. Since this is a sandbox, I will be using it to test different capabilities of JS and HTML. It's not meant to be perfect ãƒ„ 

2. A tech blog which will be able to:
- post sections of text, images, videos, etc for the blog owner in chronological order.
- Store posts on a backend server running some flavor of SQL. I plan to use PostgreSQL in the future, so maybe I should start there? This database needs to fetch stored posts to display for incoming users. 
- encode videos (educational?) into the blog post.
