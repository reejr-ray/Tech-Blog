    an HTML tag is denoted by the classic <></> keywords. E.G. <p></p>, <head></head>, <html></html> are all tags.
     - <p> would be an example of an opening tag.
     - </p> is an example of a closing tag.
     - "<p>This is a sample paragraph</p>" is an example of an HTML element.
     Tags can have attributes attached to it. these attributes add information about the elements
     - Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like name="value"
     - If an attribute does not contain a value, it is just a marker or tag.
     - - Logically equivalent to a boolean value that is true if the flag is present, and false otherwise.
     - - for example, the "hidden" attribute does not check its value. It will work the same way with hidden="True" or hidden="lorem ipsum dolor".

    custom attributes can be set using the "data-*" and its corresponding DOM dataset.property to modify their shared name
    according to where they are read or written.

    A DOM is a set of programming APIs for documents(HTML, XML, etc...). This closely resembles the structure of the documents it models.
    For example, this table from an HTML document:
    ----------------------------------------
    <table>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Shady Grove</td>
                <td>Atlantis</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Chocolate</td>
                <td>Vanilla</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    ----------------------------------------
    would be represented in the DOM like this:

                                  Table
                                    |
                             /            \
                           <tr>           <tr>
                        /       \        /     \
                      <td>     <td>    <td>   <td>
                        |       |       |       |
                 "Shady Grove"  |  "Chocolate"  |
                            "Atlantis"      "Vanilla"

    Hence, the document object model has a logical structure like a tree.
